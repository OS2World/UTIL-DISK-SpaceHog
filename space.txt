Syntax: E:\BIN\space.exe [DriveLetter[:]]

The current drive will be used if no DriveLetter is given.
The trailing colon is also optional.

This PUBLIC DOMAIN program helps you maintain the amount
of free space in the specified drive to under 2G-512 Bytes.
(Because HPFS allocates space in 512 byte units.)
Thus stopping programs using 32-bit signed integer math
from seeing space above 2G-512 bytes as negative.

If it can't find the \SPACEHOG directory in the specified
partition, it behaves like a run-of-the-mill freespace
reporting utility, albeit it can handle disk partitions up
to 999,999,999,999 bytes in size. (see Split000()) It
reports the file system type and in the case of LAN drive,
the NETBIOS alias name.

If it sees the \SPACEHOG directory, which you have to
create explicitly, it will create dummy files there as
needed to maintain the 2G-512 byte freespace ceiling for
that disk partition (you may have to run this twice). The
dummy files are named with simple integers, from 0 thru
99999999...

If the amount of reserved space needed is less than 2G-512
bytes, it will shrink or expand the size of the \SPACEHOG\0
file instead.

Warning: You use this program and its source code at your
         own risk. I provide no warranty of any kind. But
         I *do* welcome bug FIXES/reports via email to:

         wfyuen@bestweb.net

Patches: If you don't have any of the four compilers I used,
         you can change the \SPACEHOG directory to some place
         else by patching the 256 byte variable I reserved
         with a binary editor. Search for this string:

         "?:\spacehog"

         The '?' will be replaced by the program with the
         drive letter passed from the command line. Therefore,
         you need not patch that. Please make sure you end the
         new directory name with a binary 0 byte. It must not
         end with a backslash ('\')!!!
